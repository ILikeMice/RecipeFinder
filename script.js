Task: Create a Responsive Recipe Search Web Application

Objective: Design and develop a responsive web application where users can search for recipes based on ingredients they have at home. The focus should be on creating a clean, user-friendly interface with interactive elements.

Requirements:
1. Implement a search feature that allows users to input multiple ingredients and returns relevant recipes from an open recipe API (such as Spoonacular API).
2. Display the search results in a grid format, showing recipe images, names, and brief descriptions.
3. Include a detailed view for each recipe that provides a list of ingredients, preparation steps, and cooking time.
4. Make the application responsive and ensure it works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
5. Include a bookmark feature allowing users to save their favorite recipes for easy access later.
6. Ensure cross-browser compatibility and implement basic SEO practices.
7. Use clean and maintainable code with comments to explain your logic.

Deadline: 7 days from the start date.
